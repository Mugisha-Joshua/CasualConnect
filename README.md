# CasualConnect
This is a project aimed at bridging the gap between local job seekers and small businesses or households looking for informal workers(e.g., domestic help, shop assistants, casual laborers) by offering a simple, web-based job posting and browsing platform accessible via mobile devices or on the internet.
